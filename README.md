# **Abstract**

This project, which covers the econometrics course on Advanced Financial Econometrics taught by Christophe Hurlin at the ESA Master, aims to integrate the various concepts discussed in class, in particular those relating to the implementation of Minimum-Variance (MV) and Risk Parity (RP) strategies. This project stems from one of the major concerns encountered in the study of series in Advanced Financial Econometrics, the Optimal Portfolio Construction. Once implemented, a performance comparison is done between those latter and a "naive" portfolio (where the weights of the different assets are equal). 
Indeed, in a very well-known article, DeMiguel, Garlappi and Uppal [2009] have shown that the performance of a naive portfolio often exceeds the performance of portfolios built on active strategies (like the MV
or RP for example). In this latter, the authors have published active strategies developed on the unconditional variance-covariance matrix of asset returns, simply estimated by the empirical variance-covariance matrix from past results. This project aims to implement the MV and RP strategies based on the conditional variance-covariance matrix (Martellini, Milhau, and Tarelli [2014]). Questioning the conclusions of DeMiguel, Garlappi, and Uppal [2009], means checking whether the use of conditional moments improves the performance of these strategies. In other words, it is about assessing whether conditional moments-based MV and RP portfolios perform better than the naive one.
